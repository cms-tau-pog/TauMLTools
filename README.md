# TauMLTools

## Introduction

Tools to perform machine learning studies for tau lepton reconstruction and identification at CMS.

## How to install

1. Clone package from the github without loading any additional environment (like CMSSW):
   ```sh
   git clone -o cms-tau-pog -b master git@github.com:cms-tau-pog/TauMLTools.git
   ```
2. Go to `TauMLTools` directory and load appropriate environment by running `env.sh`:
   ```sh
   source env.sh ENV_NAME
   ```
   where supported `ENV_NAME` are:
   - `prod2018`: for production of root-tuples for 2018 pre-UL datasets and pre-processing steps up to Shuffle&Merge
   - `phase2`: for production of root-tuples for Phase 2 datasets and pre-processing steps up to Shuffle&Merge
   - `lcg`: using LCG environment, if it is available (e.g. lxplus)
   - `conda`: using tau-ml conda environment -- this is the recommended environment to perform an actual NN training

   N.B. If you want to use existing `conda` installation, make sure that it is activated and the path to the `conda` executable is included in `PATH` variable. If `conda` installation not found, `env.sh` will make install it from the official web site and configure it to work with the current TauMLTools installation.

The second step (`source env.sh ENV_NAME`) should be repeated each time you open a new shell session.

## How to produce inputs

Steps below describe how to process input datasets starting from MiniAOD up to the representation that can be directly used as an input for the training.

### Big root-tuples production

The big root-tuples, `TauTuple`, contain an extensive information about reconstructed tau, seeding jet, and all reco objects within tau signal and isolation cones: PF candidates, pat::Electrons and pat::Muons, and tracks.
`TauTuple` also contain the MC truth that can be used to identify the tau decay.
Each `TauTuple` entry corresponds to a single tau candidate.
Branches available within `TauTuple` are defined in [Analysis/interface/TauTuple.h](https://github.com/cms-tau-pog/TauMLTools/blob/master/Analysis/interface/TauTuple.h)
These branches are filled in CMSSW module [Production/plugins/TauTupleProducer.cc](https://github.com/cms-tau-pog/TauMLTools/blob/master/Production/plugins/TauTupleProducer.cc) that converts information stored in MiniAOD events into `TauTuple` format.

[Production/python/Production.py](https://github.com/cms-tau-pog/TauMLTools/blob/master/Production/python/Production.py) contains the configuration that allows to run `TauTupleProducer` with `cmsRun`.
Here is an example how to run `TauTupleProducer` on 1000 DY events using one MiniAOD file as an input:
```sh
cmsRun TauMLTools/Production/python/Production.py sampleType=MC_18 inputFiles=/store/mc/RunIIAutumn18MiniAOD/DYJetsToLL_M-50_TuneCP5_13TeV-madgraphMLM-pythia8/MINIAODSIM/102X_upgrade2018_realistic_v15-v1/00000/A788C40A-03F7-4547-B5BA-C1E01CEBB8D8.root maxEvents=1000
```

In order to run a large-scale production for the entire datasets, the CMS computing grid should be used via CRAB interface.
Submission and status control can be performed using [crab_submit.py](https://github.com/cms-tau-pog/TauMLTools/blob/master/Production/scripts/crab_submit.py) and [crab_cmd.py](https://github.com/cms-tau-pog/TauMLTools/blob/master/Production/scripts/crab_cmd.py) commands.

#### 2018 root-tuple production steps
1. Go to `$CMSSW_BASE/src` and load CMS and environments:
   ```sh
   cd $CMSSW_BASE/src
   cmsenv
   source /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch/common/crab-setup.sh
   ```
1. Enable VOMS proxy:
   ```sh
   voms-proxy-init -rfc -voms cms -valid 192:00
   export X509_USER_PROXY=`voms-proxy-info -path`
   ```
1. Submit task in a config file (or a set of config files) using `crab_submit.py`:
   ```sh
   crab_submit.py --workArea work-area --cfg TauMLTools/Production/python/Production.py --site T2_CH_CERN --output /store/group/phys_tau/TauML/prod_2018_v2/crab_output TauMLTools/Production/crab/configs/2018/CONFIG1.txt TauMLTools/Production/crab/configs/2018/CONFIG2.txt ...
   ```
   * For more command line options use `crab_submit.py --help`.
   * For big dataset file-based splitting should be used
   * For Embedded samples a custom DBS should be specified
1. Regularly check task status using `crab_cmd.py`:
   ```sh
   crab_cmd.py --workArea work-area --cmd status
   ```
1. Once all jobs within a given task are finished you can move it from `work-area` to `finished` folder (to avoid rerunning status each time) and set `done` for the dataset in the production google-doc.
1. If some jobs are failed: try to understand the reason and use standard crab tools to solve the problem (e.g. `crab resubmit` with additional arguments). In very problematic cases a recovery task could be created.
1. Once production is over, all produced `TauTuples` will be moved in `/eos/cms/store/group/phys_tau/TauML/prod_2018_v2/full_tuples`.



### Big tuples splitting

In order to be able to uniformly mix tau candidates from various datasets with various pt, eta and ground truth, the big tuples should be splitted into binned files.

For each input dataset run [CreateBinnedTuples](https://github.com/cms-tau-pog/TauMLTools/blob/master/Analysis/bin/CreateBinnedTuples.cxx):
```sh
DS=DY; CreateBinnedTuples --output tuples-v2/$DS --input-dir raw-tuples-v2/crab_$DS --n-threads 12 --pt-bins "20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200, 225, 250, 275, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000" --eta-bins "0., 0.575, 1.15, 1.725, 2.3"
```

Alternatively, you can use python script that iterates over all datasets in the directory:
```sh
python -u TauMLTools/Analysis/python/CreateBinnedTuples.py --input raw-tuples-v2 --output tuples-v2 --n-threads 12
```

Once all datasets are split, the raw files are no longer needed and can be removed to save the disc space.

In the root directory (e.g. `tuples-v2`) txt file with number of tau candidates in each bin should be created:
```sh
python -u TauMLTools/Analysis/python/CreateTupleSizeList.py --input /data/tau-ml/tuples-v2/ > /data/tau-ml/tuples-v2/size_list.txt
```

In case you need to update `size_list.txt` (for example you added new dataset), you can specify `--prev-output` to retrieve bin statistics from the previous run of `CreateTupleSizeList.py`:
```sh
python -u TauMLTools/Analysis/python/CreateTupleSizeList.py --input /data/tau-ml/tuples-v2/ --prev-output /data/tau-ml/tuples-v2/size_list.txt > size_list_new.txt
mv size_list_new.txt /data/tau-ml/tuples-v2/size_list.txt
```

Each split root file represents a signle bin.
The file naming convention is the following: *tauType*\_pt\_*minPtValue*\_eta\_*minEtaValue*.root, where *tauType* is { e, mu, tau, jet }, *minPtValue* and *minEtaValue* are lower pt and eta edges of the bin.
Please, note that the implementation of the following steps requires that this naming convention is respected, and the code will not function properly otherwise.

### Shuffle and merge

The goal of this step create input root file that contains uniform contribution from all input dataset, tau types, tau pt and tau eta bins in any interval of entries.
It is needed in order to have a smooth gradient descent during the training.

Steps described below are defined in [TauMLTools/Analysis/scripts/prepare_TauTuples.sh](https://github.com/cms-tau-pog/TauMLTools/blob/master/Analysis/scripts/prepare_TauTuples.sh).


#### Training inputs

Due to considerable number of bins (and therefore input files) merging is split into two steps.
1. Inputs from various datasets are merged together for each tau type. How the merging process should proceed is defined in `TauMLTools/Analysis/config/training_inputs_{e,mu,tau,jet}.cfg`.
   For each configuration [ShuffleMerge](https://github.com/cms-tau-pog/TauMLTools/blob/master/Analysis/bin/ShuffleMerge.cxx) is executed. E.g.:
   ```sh
   ShuffleMerge --cfg TauMLTools/Analysis/config/training_inputs_tau.cfg --input tuples-v2 \
                --output output/training_preparation/all/tau_pt_20_eta_0.000.root \
                --pt-bins "20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200, 225, 250, 275, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000" \
                --eta-bins "0., 0.575, 1.15, 1.725, 2.3" --mode MergeAll --calc-weights true --ensure-uniformity true \
                --max-bin-occupancy 500000 --n-threads 12  --disabled-branches "trainingWeight"
   ```
   Once finished, use `CreateTupleSizeList.py` to create `size_list.txt` in `output/training_preparation`.
1. Merge all 4 tau types together.
   ```sh
   ShuffleMerge --cfg TauMLTools/Analysis/config/training_inputs_step2.cfg --input output/training_preparation \
                --output output/training_preparation/training_tauTuple.root --pt-bins "20, 1000" --eta-bins "0., 2.3" --mode MergeAll \
                --calc-weights false --ensure-uniformity true --max-bin-occupancy 100000000 --n-threads 12
   ```

#### Testing inputs

For testing inputs there is no need to merge different datasets and tau types. Therefore, merging can be done in a single step.
```sh
ShuffleMerge --cfg TauML/Analysis/config/testing_inputs.cfg --input tuples-v2 --output output/training_preparation/testing \
             --pt-bins "20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200, 225, 250, 275, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000" \
             --eta-bins "0., 0.575, 1.15, 1.725, 2.3" --mode MergePerEntry \
             --calc-weights false --ensure-uniformity false --max-bin-occupancy 20000 \
             --n-threads 12 --disabled-branches "trainingWeight"
```
### ShuffleMergeSpectral (Alternative shuffle and merge)

This step represents alternative Shuffle and Merge procedure that aims to minimize usage of physicical memory as well as provide direct control over the shape of final (pt,eta) spectrum in a stochastic manner. Before running the following step on HTCondor for all the samples it is essential to analyze and tune the parameters of ShuffleMergeSpectral.

Spectrum of the initial data is needed to calculate the probability to take tau candidate of some genuine tau-type and from some pt-eta bin. To generate the specturum histograms for a dataset and lists with number of entries per datafile, run:
```sh
CreateSpectralHists --output "spectrum_file.root" \
                    --output_entries "entires_file.txt" \
                    --input-dir "path/to/dataset/dir" \
                    --pt-hist "n_bins_pt, pt_min, pt_max" \
                    --eta-hist "n_bins_eta, |eta|_min, |eta|_max" \
                    --n-threads 1
```
on this step it is important to have high granularity binning to be able later to re-bin into custom, non-uniform pt-eta bins on the next step.

Alternatively, if one wants to process several datasets the following python script can be used (parameters of pt and eta binning to be hardcoded in the script):
```sh
python Analysis/python/CreateSpectralHists.py --input /path/to/input/dir/ \
                                              --output /path/to/output/dir/ \
                                              --filter ".*(DY).*" \
                                              --rewrite
```
After the following step spectrums and .txt files with the number of entries will be created in the output folder. To merge all the .txt files into one and mix the lines:
```
cat <path_to_spectrums>/*.txt | shuf - > filelist_mix.txt
```
Mixing is needed to have shuffled files within one data group. After this step, filelist_mix.txt should contain filenames and the number of entries in the corresponding files:
```
./DYJetsToLL_M-50/eventTuple_1-70.root 249243
./TTJets_ext1/eventTuple_1-308.root 59414
./TTToHadronic/eventTuple_467.root 142781
./WJetsToLNu/eventTuple_25.root 400874
...
```
After spectrums are created for all datasets, the final procedure of Shuffle and Merge can be performed with:
```sh
ShuffleMergeSpectral --cfg Analysis/config/2018/training_inputs_MC.cfg
                     --input filelist_mix.txt
                     --prefix prefix_string
                     --output <path_to_output_file.root>
                     --mode MergeAll
                     --n-threads 1
                     --disabled-branches "trainingWeight, tauType"
                     --input-spec /afs/cern.ch/work/m/myshched/public/root-tuple-v2-hists
                     --pt-bins "20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 1000"
                     --eta-bins "0., 0.6, 1.2, 1.8, 2.4"
                     --tau-ratio "jet:1, e:1, mu:1, tau:1"
                     --lastbin-disbalance 100.0
                     --lastbin-takeall true
                     --refill-spectrum true
                     --enable-emptybin true
                     --job-idx 0 --n-jobs 500
```
- `--cfg` is a configuration file where data groups are constructed, each line represents data group in the format of (name, dataset_dir_regexp, file_regexp, tau_types to consider in this group), e.g: `Analysis/config/2018/training_inputs_MC.cfg`
- `--input` is the file containing the list of input files and entries (read line-by-line). The abdolute path is not taken from this file, only `../dataset/datafile.root n_events` is read. The rest of the path (the path to the dataset folders) should be specified in the `--prefix` argument.
- `--prefix` is the prefix which will be placed before the path of each file read form `--input`. Please note that this prefix will *not* be placed before the `--input-spec` value. This value can include a remote path compatible with xrootd.
- the last pt bin is taken as a high pt region, all entries from it are taken without rejection.
- `--tau-ratio "jet:1, e:1, mu:1, tau:1"` defines proportion of TauTypes in final root-tuple.
- `--refill-spectrum` to recalculated spectrums of the input data on flight, only events and files that correspond to the current job `--job-idx` will be considered. It was studied that in case of heterogeneity within a data group, the common spectrum of the whole data group poorly represents the spectrum of the sub-chunk of this data group if we use `--n-jobs 500`, so it is needed to fill spectrum histograms in the beginning of every job, to obtain required uniformity of the output.
- `--lastbin-takeall` due to the poor statistic in the high-pt region the option to take all candidates from last pt-bin is included (contrary to `--lastbin-takeall false`, in this case we put the requirement on n_entries in the last bin to be equal to n_entries in other bins)
- `--lastbin-disbalance` the argument is relevant in case of `-lastbin-takeall true`, it put the requirement on the ratio of (all entries up to the last bin) to the (number of entries in the last bin) not to be greater than required number, otherwise less events will be taken from all bins up to the last.
- `--enable-emptybin` in case of empty pt-eta bin, the probability in this bin will be set to 0 (that is needed in cases when datasets are statistically poor or the number of jobs `--n-jobs` is big in case of `--refill-spectrum true` mode)
- `--n-jobs 500 --job-idx 0` defines into how many parts to split the input files and the index of corresponding job

In order to find appropriate binning and `--tau-ratio` in correspondence to the present statistics it might be useful to execute one job in `--refill-spectrum false --lastbin-takeall false` mode and study the output of `./out/*.root` files. In the \<DataGroupName>_n.root files the number of entries in required  `--pt-bins --eta-bins` can be found. \<DataGroupName>.root files show the probability of accepting candidate from corresponding pt-eta bin.

#### ShuffleMergeSpectral on HTCondor
ShuffleMergeSpectral can be executed on condor through the [law](https://github.com/riga/law) package. To run it, first install law following [this](https://github.com/riga/law/wiki/Usage-at-CERN) instructions. Then, set up the environment
```sh
cd $CMSSW_BASE/src
cmsenv
cd TauMLTools/Analysis/law
source setup.sh
law index
```
Jobs can be submitted running
```
law run ShuffleMergeSpectral --version vx --params --n-jobs N
```
where *--params* are the [ShuffleMergeSpectral](https://github.com/cms-tau-pog/TauMLTools/blob/master/Analysis/bin/ShuffleMergeSpectral.cxx#L28-L52) parameters. In particular

   - *--input* has been renamed to *--input-path*
   - *--output* has been renamed to *--output-path*

**NOTA BENE**: *--output-path* should be a full path, otherwise the output will be lost
The full list of parameters accepted by law and ShuffleMergeSpectral can be printed with the commands

```
ShuffleMergeSpectral --help
law run ShuffleMergeSpectral --help
```

Jobs are created by the script using the *--start-entry* and *--end-entry* parameters.

Additional arguments can be used to control the condor submission:

   - *--workflow local* will run locally. If omitted, condor will be used
   - *--max-runtime* condor runtime in hours
   - *--max-memory* condor RAM request in MB
   - *--batch-name* batch name to be used on condor. Default is "TauML_law"

At this point, the worker will start reporting the job status. As long as the worker is alive, it will automatically resubmit failed jobs. The worker can be killed with **ctrl+C** once all jobs have been submitted. Failed jobs can be resubmitted running the same command used in the first submission (from the same working directory).

A *data* directory is created. This directory contains information about the jobs as well as the log, output and erorr files created by condor.

#### Validation
A validation can be run on shuffled samples to ensure that different parts of the training set have compatible distributions.
To run the validation tool, a ROOT version greater or equal to 6.16 is needed:
```
source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/LCG_97apython3/x86_64-centos7-clang10-opt/setup.sh
```
Then, run:
```
python TauMLTools/Production/scripts/validation_tool.py  --input input_directory \
                                                         --id_json /path/to/dataset_id_json_file \
                                                         --group_id_json /path/to/dataset_group_id_json_file \
                                                         --output output_directory \
                                                         --n_threads n_threads \
                                                         --legend > results.txt
```
The *id_json*  (*group_id_json*) points to a json file containing the list of datasets names (dataset group names) and their hash values, used to identify them inside the shuffled ROOT tuples. These files are needed in order to create a unique identifier which can be handled by ROOT. These files are produced at the shuffle and merge step.
The script will create the directory "output_directory" containing the results of the test.
Validation is run on the following ditributions with a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test:

- dataset_id, dataset_group_id, lepton_gen_match, sampleType
- tau_pt and tau_eta for each bin of the previous
- dataset_id for each bin of dataset_group_id

If a KS test is not successful, a warning message is print on screen.

Optional arguments are available running:
```
python TauMLTools/Production/scripts/validation_tool.py --help
```

A time benchmark is available [here](https://github.com/cms-tau-pog/TauMLTools/pull/31#issue-510206277).

### Production of flat inputs

In this stage, `TauTuple`s are transformed into flat [TrainingTuples](https://github.com/cms-tau-pog/TauMLTools/blob/master/Analysis/interface/TrainingTuple.h) that are suitable as an input for the training.

The script to that performs conversion is defined in [TauMLTools/Analysis/scripts/prepare_TrainingTuples.sh](https://github.com/cms-tau-pog/TauMLTools/blob/master/Analysis/scripts/prepare_TrainingTuples.sh).

1. Run [TrainingTupleProducer](https://github.com/cms-tau-pog/TauMLTools/blob/master/Analysis/bin/TrainingTupleProducer.cxx) to produce root files with the flat tuples. In `prepare_TrainingTuples.sh` several instances of `TrainingTupleProducer` are run in parallel specifying `--start-entry` and `--end-entry`.
   ```sh
   TrainingTupleProducer --input /data/tau-ml/tuples-v2-training-v2/training_tauTuple.root --output output/tuples-v2-training-v2-t1-root/training-root/part_0.root
   ```
1. Convert root files into HDF5 format:
   ```sh
   python TauMLTools/Analysis/python/root_to_hdf.py --input output/tuples-v2-training-v2-t1-root/training-root/part_0.root \
                                                    --output output/tuples-v2-training-v2-t1-root/training/part_0.h5 \
                                                    --trees taus,inner_cells,outer_cells
   ```

## Training NN

### Single run
In order to have organized storage of models and its associated files, [mlflow](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html) is used from the training step onwards. At the training step, it takes care of logging necessary configuration parameters used to run the given training, plus additional artifacts, i.e. associated files like model/cfg files or output logs). Conceptually, mlflow augments the training code with additional logging of requested parameters/files whenever it is requested. Please note that hereafter mlflow notions of __run__ (a single training) and __experiment__ (a group of runs) will be used. 

The script to perform the training is [TauMLTools/Training/python/2018v1/Training_v0p1.py](https://github.com/cms-tau-pog/TauMLTools/blob/master/Training/python/2018v1/Training_v0p1.py). It is supplied with a corresponding [TauMLTools/Training/python/2018v1/train.yaml](https://github.com/cms-tau-pog/TauMLTools/blob/master/Training/python/2018v1/train.yaml) configuration file which specifies input configuration parameters. Here, [hydra](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/) is used to compose the final configuration given the specification inside of `train.yaml` and, optionally, from a command line (see below), which is then passed as [OmegaConf](https://omegaconf.readthedocs.io/) dictionary to `main()` function. 

The specification consists of:
* the main training configuration file [`TauMLTools/Training/configs/training_v1.yaml`](https://github.com/cms-tau-pog/TauMLTools/blob/master/Training/configs/training_v1.yaml) describing `DataLoader` and model configurations, which is "imported" by hydra as a [defaults list](https://hydra.cc/docs/advanced/defaults_list/)
* mlflow parameters, specifically `path_to_mlflow` (to the folder storing mlflow runs, usually its default name is `mlruns`) and `experiment_name`.  These two parameters are needed to either create an mlflow experiment with a given `experiment_name` (if it doesn't exist) or to find the experiment to which attribute the current run
* `scaling_cfg` which specifies the path to the json file with feature scaling parameters
* `gpu_cfg` which sets the gpu related parameters 
* `log_suffix` used as a postfix in output directory names

Also note that one can conveniently [add/remove/override](https://hydra.cc/docs/advanced/override_grammar/basic/) __any__ configuration items from the command line. Otherwise, running `python Training_v0p1.py` will use default values as they are composed by hydra based on `train.yaml`.

An example of running the training would be:
```sh
python Training_v0p1.py experiment_name=run3_cnn_ho2 'training_cfg.SetupNN.tau_net={ activation: "PReLU", dropout_rate: 0.2, reduction_rate: 1.4, first_layer_width: "2*n*(1+drop)", last_layer_width: "n*(1+drop)" }' 'training_cfg.SetupNN.comp_net={ activation: "PReLU", dropout_rate: 0.2, reduction_rate: 1.6, first_layer_width: "2*n*(1+drop)", last_layer_width: "n*(1+drop)" }' 'training_cfg.SetupNN.comp_merge_net={ activation: "PReLU", dropout_rate: 0.2, reduction_rate: 1.6, first_layer_width: "n", last_layer_width: 64 }' 'training_cfg.SetupNN.conv_2d_net={ activation: "PReLU", dropout_rate: 0.2, reduction_rate: null, window_size: 3 }' 'training_cfg.SetupNN.dense_net={ activation: "PReLU", dropout_rate: 0.2, reduction_rate: 1, first_layer_width: 200, last_layer_width: 200, min_n_layers: 4 }'
```

Here, a new mlflow run will be created under the "run3_cnn_ho2" experiment (if the experiment doesn't exist, it will be created). Then, the model is composed and compiled and the training proceeds via a usual `fit()` method with `DataLoader` class instance used as a batch yielder. Several callbacks are also implemented to monitor the training process, specifically `CSVLogger`, `TimeCheckpoint` and `TensorBoard` callback. Lastly, note that the parameters related to the NN setup and initially specified in `training_v1.yaml` are overriden via the command line (`training_cfg.SetupNN.{param}=...`)

Furthermore, for the sake of convenience, submission of multiple trainings in parallel to the batch system is implemented as a dedicated law task. As an example, running the following commands will set up law and submit the trainings specified in `TauMLTools/Training/configs/input_run3_cnn_ho1.txt` to `htcondor`: 

```sh
source setup.sh
law index
law run Training --version input_run3_cnn_ho1 --workflow htcondor --working-dir /nfs/dust/cms/user/mykytaua/softDeepTau/DeepTau_master_hyperparam-law/TauMLTools/Training/python/2018v1 --input-cmds /nfs/dust/cms/user/mykytaua/softDeepTau/DeepTau_master_hyperparam-law/TauMLTools/Training/configs/input_run3_cnn_ho1.txt --conda-path /nfs/dust/cms/user/mykytaua/softML/miniconda3/bin/conda --max-memory 40000 --max-runtime 20
```

### Combining multiple runs
It might be the case that trainings from a common mlflow experiment are distributed amongst several people (e.g. for the purpose of hyperparameter optimisation), so that each person runs their fraction on their personal/institute hardware, and then all the mlflow runs are to be combined together under the same folder. Naive copying and merging of `mlruns` folders under the common folder wouldn't work because several parameters in `meta.yaml` files (mlflow internal cfg files stored per run and per experiment in corresponding folders) are not synchronised accross the team in their mlflow experiments. Specifically, in each of those files the following parameters require changes:

1. `artifact_location` (`meta.yaml` for each experiment) needs to be set to a common merged directory and the same change needs to be propagated to `artifact_uri` (`meta.yaml` for each run).
1. `experiment_id` needs to be set to a new common experiment ID (`meta.yaml` for each experiment and for each run).

These points are not a problem if the end goal is a simple file storage. However, mlflow is being used in the current training procedure mostly to improve UX with dedicated [`mlflow UI`](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#tracking-ui) for a better navigation through the trainings and their convenient comparison. In that case, mlflow UI requires a properly structured `mlruns` folder to correctly read and visualise run-related information.

For the purpose of preparing individual's `mlruns` folder for merging, [`set_mlflow_paths.py`](https://github.com/cms-tau-pog/TauMLTools/blob/master/Training/python/set_mlflow_paths.py) script was written. What it does is:
1. recursively going through the folders in user-specified `path_to_mlflow` and corresponding experiment `exp_id` therein, opening firstly the experiment-related `meta.yaml` and resetting there `artifact_location` to `new_path_to_exp`, which is defined as a concatenation of user-specified `new_path_to_mlflow` and `exp_id` or `new_exp_id` (if passed)
1. opening run-related `meta.yaml` files and resetting `artifact_uri` key to `new_path_to_exp`, plus resetting `experiment_id` to `new_exp_id` (if passed)
1. in case `new_exp_id` argument is provided, the whole experiment folder is renamed to this new ID  

It has the following input arguments:
* `-p`, `--path-to-mlflow`: (required) Path to local folder with mlflow experiments
* `-id`, `--exp-id`: (required) Experiment id in the specified mlflow folder to be modified.
* `-np`, `--new-path-to-mlflow`: (required) New path to be set throughout `meta.yaml` configs for a specified mlflow experiment.
* `-nid`, `--new-exp-id`: (optional, default=None) If passed, will also reset the current experiment id.
* `-nn`, `--new-exp-name`: (optional, default=None) If passed, will also reset the current experiment name.

Therefore, the following workflow is suggested:
1. One runs their fraction of a common mlflow experiment at machine(s) of their choice. At this point it is not really important to have a common experiment name/experiment ID across all the team since it will be anyway unified afterwards. The outcome of this step is one has got locally a folder `${WORKDIR}/mlruns/${EXP_ID}` which contains the trainings as mlflow run folders + experiment-related `meta.yaml`.
1. The team aggrees that the combined experiment name is `${NEW_EXP_NAME}` with a corresponding ID `${NEW_EXP_ID}` and the directory where the runs distributed across the team are to be stored is `${SHARED_DIR}/mlruns`. Below will assume that this directory is located on `lxplus`.
1. Everyone in the team runs `set_mlflow_paths.py` script at the machine where the training was happening:
   ```sh
   python set_mlflow_paths.py -p ${WORKDIR}/mlruns -id ${exp_id} -np ${SHARED_DIR}/mlruns -nid ${NEW_EXP_ID} -nn ${NEW_EXP_NAME}
   ```
1. Everyone in the team copies runs from the shared experiment from their local machines to `${SHARED_DIR}`, e.g. using `rsync` (note that below `--dry-run` option is on, remove it to do the actual synching):
   ```sh
   rsync --archive --compress --verbose --human-readable --progress --inplace --dry-run ${WORKDIR}/mlruns ${USERNAME}@lxplus.cern.ch:${SHARED_DIR}
   ```
   **NB:** this command will synchronise **all** experiment folders inside of `${WORKDIR}/mlruns` with those of `${SHARED_DIR}/mlruns`. Make sure that this won't cause troubles and clashes for experiments which are not `${EXP_ID}`.
1. Now, it should be possible to bring up mlflow UI and inspect the merged runs altogether:
   ```sh
   cd ${SHARED_DIR}
   mlflow ui -p 5000 # 5000 is the default port
   # forward this port to a machine with graphics
   ```

## Testing NN performance

1. Apply training for all testing dataset using [TauMLTools/Training/python/apply_training.py](https://github.com/cms-tau-pog/TauMLTools/blob/master/Training/python/apply_training.py):
   ```sh
   python TauMLTools/Training/python/apply_training.py --input "TUPLES_DIR" --output "PRED_DIR" \
           --model "MODEL_FILE.pb" --chunk-size 1000 --batch-size 100 --max-queue-size 20
   ```
1. Run [TauMLTools/Training/python/evaluate_performance.py](https://github.com/cms-tau-pog/TauMLTools/blob/master/Training/python/evaluate_performance.py) to produce ROC curves for each testing dataset and tau type:
   ```sh
   python TauMLTools/Training/python/evaluate_performance.py --input-taus "INPUT_TRUE_TAUS.h5" \
           --input-other "INPUT_FAKE_TAUS.h5" --other-type FAKE_TAUS_TYPE \
           --deep-results "PRED_DIR" --deep-results-label "RESULTS_LABEL" \
           --prev-deep-results "PREV_PRED_DIR" --prev-deep-results-label "PREV_LABEL" \
           --output "OUTPUT.pdf"
   ```
   Or modify [TauMLTools/Training/scripts/eval_perf.sh](https://github.com/cms-tau-pog/TauMLTools/blob/master/Training/scripts/eval_perf.sh) according to your needs to produce plots for multiple datasets.
